    // could not extend on to other class in java. However, you can implement any number of interface for a class.

    // Interface is nothing, but it is a guideline for the new implementation it provides some instructions for new implementation
    // and categorise the functionality of the object. In details like if we create an interface then we create an instruction for
    // the implementation.
